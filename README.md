# Data Model, API & Efficient Retrieval
Database Schema for Circles:

* Circles Table: Store circles with fields for unique identifiers, circle names, types (school or community), and parent-child relationships to establish hierarchies.

* Users Table: Store user information, including user ID, username, hashed password, and user-specific details.

* UserCircles Table: Establish a many-to-many relationship between users and circles, storing user IDs and circle IDs.

Example

* Circles (circleId, circleName, circleType, parentCircleId)

* Users (userId, username, password, ...additional fields)

* UserCircles (userId, circleId)

# Circle Creation and User Addition:

* When a new user signs up, the system checks if the required circles (based on the school and class info) already exist.

* If they don't exist, create the circles and link them appropriately.

* Add the user to the corresponding circles by inserting records into the UserCircles table.

# Parent Posting to a Circle
Posting Logic:

* Ensure the parent belongs to the circle before allowing them to post.

* Implement logic to create threads and replies, ensuring each post has a unique identifier and links back to its parent post if it's a reply.

Example Schema:

Posts (postId, userId, circleId, content, parentPostId, createdAt, updatedAt)

Votes (voteId, userId, postId, voteType)

# API Workflow:

* Create Post: Verify user membership in the circle, insert the post into the Posts table.

* Reply to Post: Verify user membership, ensure the reply links back to the correct parent post.

* Vote on Post/Reply: Insert or update vote entries in the Votes table.

Only allow thread creation at the first level of replies

# Schema Evolution
Handling Parent-Initiated Circles:

* Allow parents to create new circles, storing these in the Circles table with references to parent circles .

Adapting to Grade Changes:

* Update user memberships in the UserCircles table when children's grades change, ensuring they are moved to the appropriate circles.

Example Updates:

*Add new circles for parent-initiated groups.

* Use a scheduled job or trigger to update user circle memberships based on grade progression.

# Enhancements for New Circles
Schema Update:

* Enhance the Circles table to include fields for discoverability tags or keywords, making it easier to search and join circles.

* Allow for hierarchical relationships within circles for sub-groups like "Bus No. 92".

# API Development:

* Retrieve Potential Circles: Develop an API endpoint that fetches all circles based on search criteria, user interests, or tags.

* Discoverability Mechanism: Implement filtering and sorting mechanisms to rank circles by relevance or popularity.

# API Workflow:

* Get Circles: Fetch circles based on user interests, tags, or geographic proximity.

* Join Circle: Allow users to request to join or automatically join circles based on predefined criteria.
